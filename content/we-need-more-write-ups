### Write-ups, we need more write-ups

Since a while now i work to get more and more in infosec. 
I set my mind on becoming an OSCP years ago. Honestly, it's a good certification that requires a lot of discipline and hard work for me. As I have been working on it for so long, I will continue to work on it and take the exam in the summer again. 

Personally, I've had a lot of fun learning in the Offsec platform so far and I've learned a lot. Most of all, however, the mindset that you need to turn every frustration into something good. To joyfully accept everything that I cannot yet solve as a challenge and to grow in the process.

However, what I put off for far too long and lost sight of were the plans to feed this blog here and share my experiences. 

I have played CTFs before. My first touches were on gracker.org. I also tried my hand at other events but just wasn't ready back then. 

I heard about picoCTF.org for the first time at the Chaos Communication Camp 2023. 

Which ended up in my notes from then on. I had already started the blog for the write-ups but then.... long silence. 

What woke me up was a failed exam attempt and a very well-written roadmap from S1r1us.

So in the next few weeks I will create write-ups on topics from the PG-Practice Labs which I will be doing daily as well as write-ups on challenges from picoCTF.
